Summary
=======
A simple "framework" for ROS-based 2D and 3D object recognition software.

=============
You find a description of the project in docs/project_description.pdf.
docs/thesis.pdf contains a more detailed description but it's not up-to-date
anymore.
The following video provides an overview and demonstrations:

Requirements
============
ROS
OpenCV 3 (only for 2D object recognition)
PCL 1.7  (only for 3D object recognition)
Eigen 3  (only for 3D object recognition)
Qt5 (not necessary if you do not compile the GUI-files)

Compilation
===========
1. Follow ROS installation (Desktop Full Install): http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
	I needed to enable mysql (sudo systemctl enable mysql) for this to work.
2. Create catkin workspace:
	mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
	cd ~/catkin_ws
	catkin_make
3. Clone project:
	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/joffman/ros_object_recognition.git
4. Copy/Move src folder into your workspace.
	cp -r ~/ros_object_recognition/src/* ~/catkin_ws/src/
5. Compile:
	cd ~/catkin_ws
	catkin_make
